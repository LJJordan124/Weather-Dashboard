# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Intoduction to the Functionality

Challenges to the Project?

There was a lot of ideas I could've done style-wise, however I put my majority of my focus on the HTML and JavaScript before organizing containers. It was a new way of working, but I wanted to be confident in it's functionality. To improve this project in the future, I wish to add a background depending on the weather, but have it animated. Because I have never played with animations yet in coding, I held that off for just a future experiment.
